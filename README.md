Solving optimization problems

File1:

Simplex method: This code implements an iterative optimization method to solve a linear programming problem 
by pivoting through the table of coefficients and constraints to find the optimal solution.

File2:

Program that involves solving an optimization problem using the simplex method and comparing the results with the Interpoint method
